<h1>BeaverHacks2021</h1>
<p>Our contribution for BeaverHacks Fall 2021 shows a user their carbon footprint and how they can improve it over time! </p>
<p>The user is asked a series of questions to determine their yearly CO2 emissions in lbs.</p>
<p>Our goal is to show a graph with the user's cumulative lifetime footprint over time, along with different trajectories based upon life choices they could make.
The final graph will look something like this:</p>

<p><u><strong>Requirements</strong></u></p>
<li>Python3</li>
<li>Plotly (in a future version, hopefully)</li>

<p><u><strong>Usage</strong></u></p>
<li>Simply run main.py as you normally would and follow the prompts</li>

<p><u><strong>To be added</strong></u></p>
<li>Currently only one instance of the the user exists. We will add other instances for modified trajectories</li>
<li>Implement Plotly</li>
<li>Add a line on the graph for the average American</li>
<li>Add sources to this README (Generally the EPA)</li>
<li>Add screenshots of plotly graphs and general usage</li>
<li>Make presentation video</li>
