<h1>BeaverHacks2021</h1>
<p>Our contribution for BeaverHacks Fall 2021 shows a user their carbon footprint and how they can improve it over time! </p>
<p>The user is asked a series of questions to determine their yearly CO2 emissions in lbs.</p>
<p>Our goal is to show a graph with the user's cumulative lifetime footprint over time, along with different trajectories based upon life choices they could make.
The final graph will look something like this:</p>
